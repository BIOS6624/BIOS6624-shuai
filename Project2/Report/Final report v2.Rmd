# Power
Sample size and power analysis were conducted using a simulation study with a logistic model. Simulations for sample size of aim 1 were based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which was restricted to participants aged 60–75 and further subset to include only those with average MIMS values below the 25th percentile. Parallel computing was implemented to accelerate the simulations, with all analyses conducted in R version 4.3.3.

## Aim 1
For Aim 1, we will assess whether the ACTUP intervention reduces the risk of 7-year all-cause mortality in sedentary adults aged 60–75 using a logistic regression model. The effect of gender, with females as the reference group, will be estimated through a logistic regression model with mortality as the outcome and gender as the predictor. A grid search will be conducted to identify the treatment coefficient corresponding to a 7% reduction in mortality.

Each simulated sample will maintain a 1:1 ratio of men to women and a 1:1 ratio of participants in the control and treatment groups. Mortality in the simulated data will be modeled as a binary variable, with the probability estimated using a logit link function that incorporates coefficients for both gender and treatment group. Sample sizes will range from 100 to 2000, increasing in increments of 50. For more precise results, the sample size range will then narrow to 1450–1550, increasing in increments of 10. The simulated data will be analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model, with mortality as the outcome and treatment and gender as predictors. This process will be repeated 10,000 times, and the power will be calculated as the proportion of iterations yielding statistically significant results out of 10,000. The minimal sample size required to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.05 will be used for the simulations in Aim 2. Mortality in the simulated data will be modeled as a binary variable, with the probability estimated using a logit link function that incorporates coefficients for the intercept, gender, and treatment group, which are -0.48, 0.227, and -0.3004, respectively. The left side of Figure 1 shows that a sample size of 1,510 is the minimum required to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.05, assuming the intervention reduces the probability of 7-year all-cause mortality risk by 7%.

## Aim 2
To determine whether the efficacy of the ACTUP intervention is moderated by gender, we will fit a second logistic regression model with mortality as the outcome and treatment, gender, and their interaction term as predictors. This model will evaluate if there are significant gender-specific differences in the treatment effect. Each simulated sample will maintain a 1:1 ratio of men to women and a 1:1 ratio of participants in the control and treatment groups. Mortality in the simulated data will be modeled as a binary variable, with the probability estimated using a logit link function that incorporates the coefficients for gender, treatment, and their interaction. The sample sizes used will align with the optimal results identified from Aim 1. The interaction coefficient will range from -1 to 0, increasing in increments of 0.01. The simulated data will be analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model, with mortality as the outcome and treatment, gender, and their interaction as predictors. This process will be repeated 10,000 times, and power will be calculated as the proportion of iterations yielding statistically significant interaction effects across the 10,000 simulations.

The right side of Figure 1 shows that an interaction coefficient of -0.63 is the maximum required to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.05, assuming the intervention reduces the probability of 7-year all-cause mortality risk by 7%. In this scenario, the probability of death for an individual can be modeled as:$p = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{gender} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{treatment} + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{gender} \times \text{treatment}))\right)}$, where $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$ are the coefficients for the intercept, gender, treatment group, and the interaction between gender and treatment, respectively. The analysis indicated that an absolute reduction of 8% in mortality risk for males compared to females can be detected with 80% power.

# Statistical Analysis

The minimal sample size required to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.05 will be used for the simulations in Aim 2.

7-year all-cause mortality was calculated using a logistic regression model with gender, intervention, and their interaction as predictors.  
Aim 1: the difference in mortality of treatment or control will be estimated by logistic model to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.05

Aim 2: the difference in mortality of treated male and treated female will be estimated by logistic model to achieve 80% power at a significance level of 0.05.
