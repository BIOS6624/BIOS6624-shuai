# Introduction

The data used in this analysis come from the ongoing Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a prospective cohort study designed to understand the natural and treated histories of HIV-1 infection in homosexual and bisexual men across four major cities in the United States. This dataset includes eight years of longitudinal data from 715 HIV-infected men, capturing laboratory measurements, quality of life scores, demographic information, and other health-related data collected after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which is the standard treatment for patients with HIV.

The primary research question is to examine how treatment response, two years after initiating HAART, differs between individuals who reported hard drug use at baseline and those who did not. Four key measures of treatment response are considered: viral load, CD4+ T cell counts, and physical and mental quality of life scores.

# Methods

## Data cleaning
Baseline and two year measurement was filtered for further analysis since the purpose of this project is find out how treatment response differ two years after treatment. The data with BMI greater than 200 or less than 0 was removed since it is impossible. The records with complete case was used for further analysis and the number of observations was reduced to 425. Furthermore, BMI was categorized to four levels underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), healthy (BMI 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2), overweight(BMI 24.9 - 30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). Adherence was dichotomized into >=95% and <95%. The education levels was collapsed into three levels (High school or before, Some college, and Graduate or Post-graduate).  

## Data analysis

Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches were employed to assess differences in treatment response by baseline hard drug use. The four key outcomes used to assess treatment response were viral load, CD4+ T cell counts, and physical and mental quality of life scores (AGG_PHYS and AGG_MENT). The objective was to model the impact of hard drug use, adjusting for several covariates, including baseline treatment response, BMI, age, education level, and adherence. Viral load, due to its skewed distribution, was log-transformed to meet the assumption of normality. For the frequentist approach, four multivariable linear regression models were fitted, each predicting one of the treatment response outcomes. The model assumptions—independence, linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality—were carefully evaluated using standard diagnostic tools. Independence was verified by inspecting the structure of the data and residuals. Linearity was checked by assessing the relationship between predictors and outcome variables using residual plots. Homoscedasticity was evaluated using residuals vs. fitted values plots. Normality of residuals was tested through QQ-plots.

For Bayesian regression models, both non-informative and vague priors were used. The non-informative priors of beta are distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 10^7. The vague priors of beta are distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 10^6. The prior distribution for the model error was set as a half-Cauchy distribution with a scale parameter of 2.5. Bayesian inference was carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Each model was run with 4 MCMC chains, with each chain consisting of 2,000 iterations, including a 1,000 iteration burn-in period to ensure convergence. The posterior distributions for all model parameters were summarized, and credible intervals were used to quantify uncertainty in the estimates.

For the frequentist models, standard metrics such as p-values and confidence intervals were used to assess the significance and effect sizes of the predictors. For the Bayesian models, the convergence of MCMC chains was assessed through trace plots. Posterior means and 95% credible intervals were reported for each parameter to provide a full picture of the uncertainty around the estimates.

R version 4.4.4 was used for all models.

# Result
The percentage of missing data is visualized in Figure 1, where it is evident that approximately 30% of the data is missing for the four outcome measurements of treatment response at year 2 and education level. Viral load, CD4+ T cell count at baseline, and BMI level had a smaller amount of missing data, ranging from 3.4% to 5.9%. In contrast, physical and mental quality of life at baseline, age, and adherence had almost no missing data. After excluding participants with any missing values, 425 participants were retained for analysis, which constitutes 58% of the total sample. Among the participants with complete cases, 35 (8.2%) identified as hard drug users. These details are summarized in Table 1.

The coefficients for hard drug use from both the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach (with vague priors) are presented in Table 2. Both the 95% confidence interval (frequentist) and the 95% credible interval (Bayesian) are reported to account for uncertainty in the estimates. While Table 3 contains the coefficients and credible intervals from the Bayesian approach using noninformative priors, the estimates from the Bayesian approach with vague priors are closer to the frequentist estimates. Therefore, the interpretation focuses on the results from the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach with vague priors, without including the noninformative priors in the following discussion.

## Frequentist


After adjusting for baseline log viral load, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the frequentist multivariable linear regression model suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had 0.96 times the viral load compared to those who did not identify as hard drug users at baseline (95% CI: (0.39, 2.39), p value = 0.9367). This indicates that, on average, hard drug users had a slightly lower viral load compared to non-drug users.

After adjusting for baseline CD4+ T cell counts, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the frequentist multivariable linear regression model suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had 186.284 lower CD4+ T cell counts compared to those who did not identify as hard drug users at baseline with the confidence interval suggesting that the true difference could range from a reduction of 124 to 249 CD4+ T cell(p value < 0.05). 

After adjusting for baseline physical quality of life score, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the frequentist multivariable linear regression model suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had an average 3.32-point lower physical quality of life score compared to non-drug users (95% CI: -6.02, -0.62). The confidence interval indicates that the true difference in physical quality of life score could range from a reduction of 6.02 to 0.62 points, and since the p-value is less than 0.05, this result is statistically significant, indicating a meaningful negative association between hard drug use and physical quality of life.

After adjusting for baseline physical quality of life score, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the frequentist multivariable linear regression model suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had an average 1.17-point lower physical quality of life score compared to non-drug users (95% CI: -4.60, -2.25). The confidence interval indicates that the true difference in physical quality of life score could range from a reduction of 4.60 to 2.25 points, and since the p-value is less than 0.05, this result is statistically significant. This suggests a meaningful negative association between hard drug use and physical quality of life. 

## Bayesian

After adjusting for baseline log viral load, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the Bayesian multivariable linear regression model using vague priors suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had 0.96 times the viral load compared to those who did not identify as hard drug users at baseline (95% credible interval: 0.40, 2.34). This indicates that, on average, hard drug users had a slightly lower viral load compared to non-drug users, although the wide credible interval suggests considerable uncertainty, with the possibility that the true effect could range from a substantial reduction to a potential increase in viral load. 

After adjusting for baseline CD4+ T cell count, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the Bayesian multivariable linear regression model using vague priors suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had an average 186.05 lower CD4+ T cell count compared to those who did not identify as hard drug users at baseline (95% credible interval: -247.84, -123.01). This result indicates a significant reduction in CD4+ T cell count among hard drug users, with the credible interval suggesting that the true reduction could range from 123 to 248 cells, reflecting a meaningful negative impact of hard drug use on CD4+ T cell levels.

After adjusting for baseline physical quality of life score, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the Bayesian multivariable linear regression model using vague priors suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had an average 3.31-point lower physical quality of life score compared to those who did not identify as hard drug users at baseline (95% credible interval: -6.07, -0.61). This result indicates a significant reduction in physical quality of life among hard drug users, with the credible interval suggesting that the true reduction could range from 0.61 to 6.07 points, reflecting a meaningful negative association between hard drug use and physical quality of life.

After adjusting for baseline mental quality of life score, age, BMI, education levels, and adherence, the Bayesian multivariable linear regression model using noninformative priors suggests that patients who identified as hard drug users at baseline had an average 1.18-point lower mental quality of life score compared to those who did not identify as hard drug users at baseline (95% credible interval: -4.53, 2.24). This result suggests a potential reduction in mental quality of life among hard drug users, but the wide credible interval, which crosses zero, indicates uncertainty about the direction and significance of the effect, meaning the true impact could range from a substantial reduction to a potential increase in mental quality of life. 

# Conclusion

According to the results from both the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach with vague priors, there is no evidence of a significant difference in viral load or mental quality of life scores between patients with different hard drug use statuses. Similarly, there is no evidence of a difference in CD4+ T cell counts or physical quality of life scores between hard drug users and non-users. Overall, the results from both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches with vague priors are consistent and yield similar conclusions.

One limitation of this study is the small proportion of participants who reported hard drug use at baseline (only 8.2%). This low percentage reduces the power of the analysis and may hinder the ability to detect subtle effects. Collecting more data, particularly from hard drug users, would improve the precision of the results and provide a stronger basis for drawing conclusions about the impact of hard drug use on treatment outcomes.
